    "text": "USCOTS 2023ISI-BUDS\n\n\n\nBackground\nIn late May/early June of 2023, I attended the United States Conference Of Teaching Statistics in State College, Pennsylvania along with several peers and professors from Cal Poly. USCOTS is a conference that consists of a myriad of workshops, each presented by professors from universities across the United States (and a few from abroad!). There were also various presentations and opportunities to discuss with colleagues interested in similar areas relating to statistics and statistics education. The theme of USCOTS 2023 was communicating with and about data.\n\n\nDay One\nOn day one, I helped facilitate a workshop run by three Cal Poly professors: Dr. Glanz, Dr. Theobold, and Dr. Robinson by live testing questions from participants and assisting with participants’ issues as they arose.\n\n\n\nFrom left to right: Emily Robinson, Allison Theobold, Sean Leader, Hunter Glanz\n\n\nThe workshop covered Quarto, a versatile tool that allows users to create reproducible documents that integrate both code and text together. As a matter of fact, my website is built entirely in Quarto. We focused on using Quarto as a classroom resource - not only as a way for professors to create course materials such as presentations or websites, but also as a way for students to create reproducible documents for class assignments.\n\n\nDay Two\nOn day two, I attended two workshops, each of which focused on improving student learning outcomes using nontraditional methodologies.\n\nImproving students’ communication about data using online statistical games\nThis workshop provided a handful of games meant to teach statistical concepts through the lens of games that engage students in the learning process. We played two games.\n\nA crop-growing game that teaches students about random variation, blocking, and linear modelling.\nA racing game that teaches students about outliers, paired data, and confounding.\n\nIf you’re interesting in exploring any of these games, please check out their resources here: https://www.stat2games.sites.grinnell.edu\n\n\nCommunicating progress in a statistics course through non-traditional grading\nThis workshop discussed non-traditional grading schemes that focus on qualitative grading schemes that de-emphasize numeric scores on particular assignments or exams, and instead focus on giving comprehensive feedback and allowing students to resubmit assignments multiple times. I think this grading scheme is particularly interesting, especially in the era of generative AI, as traditional grading methods may be more susceptible to abuse by students using services such as ChatGPT or Google Bard.\n\n\n\nDay Three / Four\nDays Three and Four consisted of a mixture of a few types of events:\n\nKeynote Presentations\nIn keynote presentations at USCOTS 2023, one speaker presented to the entirety of the conference attendees. These presentations focused heavily on the conference theme, providing a diverse set of perspectives on how statisticians and data scientists can enhance their communication skills with and about data. My favorite of the keynotes was Larry Lesser’s presentation on ‘edutainment’, a teaching paradigm that treats students’ entertainment, well-being, and engagement as paramount.\n\n\nBreakout Sessions\nBreakout sessions were short, fast-paced dialogues between presenters and attendees. During a given time slot, there were about 10 different breakout sessions one could attend based on their interests. Here are a few highlight sessions I attended:\n\nData Science as a general education course\n\nIn this session hosted by Hunter Glanz, we conversed about data science as a terminal (not meant to lead into another course) general education course, where we discussed how to introduce topics about data science to a general audience. Given that data science is a complex and nuanced subject often taught after prerequisite courses, it is not obvious which topics deserve coverage in terminal course that may be taught to anyone, STEM or non-STEM. Dr. Glanz will be releasing a book by the name ‘Data For All’ (which I will contribute to during my graduate studies!) that is meant to do exactly this, so be on the lookout!\n\nWhat makes a compelling visualization?\n\nThis meeting hosted by Beth Chance and Emily Robinson discussed how to create informative and communicative visualizations, touching on both what to do as well as what not to do. This session sparked a great dialogue which gave me further insight on how to make compelling visuals at both an introductory and advanced level.\n\n\n\n\nPoster Talks\nDuring poster talks, dozens of participants presented their novel research on countless topics, ranging from phone apps meant to teach statistics to research on medieval-era data. In these talks, I was able to converse one-on-one with the various participants and ask (too many) questions about what they had done. My personal favorite of these posters taught students to compare traditional statistical modelling methodologies to some contemporary algorithmic techniques.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nThis was the first conference I have ever attended. Although I would say I experienced a bit of information overload, I would not trade the experience for anything. I met many wonderful individuals and was welcomed with open arms to the statistics education community. I especially appreciated that although 99% (forgive my lackadaisical estimation) of attendees either had or were pursuing their PhDs, I was treated as an equal. Thank you to the organizers, presenters, sponsors, and attendees for providing me with a truly unforgettable experience.\n\n\n\nA picture of myself, Dr. Beth Chance, and the three other undergradates who attended USCOTS 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBackground\nISI-BUDS is a 6-week program in biostatistics and data science hosted by UC Irvine. It is part of a larger set of 10 programs across the United States sponsored by both the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. I attended this program in summer of 2023, along with 14 other undergraduate students from all over the country.\n\n\nEducational Content\nThe first three weeks of the program were dedicated to preparing us for the eventual project work through a combination of lectures and labs on a wide array of concepts. Much of the content was familiar to me, but I learned some new highly valuable skills that I wasn’t anticipating. A non-exhaustive list of the content we covered is as follows:\n\nData Collection\n\nInterplay between science and statistics\nStudy designs\n\nCoding\n\nR & Tidyverse\n\nReproducibility\nData Manipulation\nData Visualization\n\nMonte Carlo\n\nIntegration\nMethods for Inference\nImportance Sampling\n\n\nTheory\n\nProbability Theory\nStatistical distributions\n\nModeling\n\nGeneralized Linear Models\nMixed Effects Models\nCovariates\n\nAdjustments\nInterpretations\nMathematical Implications\n\n\n\n\n\nAlzheimer’s Disease Project\nThe last three weeks of the program consisted of applying the skills covered in the prior weeks to a research project in the area of biostatistics. Each student was assigned to one of four projects based on their interest in each particular research area. I was placed on a project with three other students that investigated the research attitudes of populations of particular interest to Alzheimer’s Disease research.\nThroughout this project, we learned a new paradigm for doing research that challenged our preconceived ideas of how research is done. This paradigm focuses much more on the work that takes place prior to modeling, placing a much larger emphasis on formulating the model specification in accordance with the research question of interest. With an awareness of the reproducibility crisis, our mentors ensured that we were carefully specifying which decisions were made before and after seeing the data and fitting models to ensure that our analyses are clearly specified.\nOur primary mentor for our research project was Dan Gillen, the head of the Statistics department at UC Irvine. We also worked with Josh Grill, Ira Lott, and Eric Doran for expertise in the Alzheimer’s Disease and Down Syndrome communities. I cannot begin to stress how impactful Dan Gillen’s mentorship was on my statistical thinking over the course of the program. Although I have a solid foundation in the principles of statistics, Dr. Gillen challenged me to think about things in a new light and provided invaluable guidance throughout our research project. Also, a special thank-you to Thuy Lu, our PhD student advisor, who assisted us at every turn and helped streamline the learning and research process.\n\n\n\nA photo of various mathematical equations used in our research project\n\n\nOur research project culminated in a presentation and research paper. The presentation allowed us to communicate our findings and practice our statistical communication skills with active members of the statistics community, which is a unique audience I don’t often have the chance to engage with. All of the presentations given by the other groups were insightful and meaningful, ranging from research on colorectal cancer to managing HIV for women in India.\n\n\n\nA picture of my research group after our final presentation\n\n\nWe hope to publish our research paper soon, so I will update this page with the link if and when that happens!\n\n\nOutside the classroom\nIn addition to the rigorous and rewarding academic program we were participating in, there was ample time to socialize and connect with the other undergraduate students attending the program. ISI-BUDS provided each student with a free ARC (Anteater Recreation Center) membership that granted access to all facilities. Over the course of the program, we played countless sports including basketball, volleyball, tennis, spikeball, and swimming.\nThe coordinators of ISI-BUDS were also generous enough to plan a few expeditions for us on a few of the weekends, where we went kayaking and whale watching! These events brought our cohort closer together and bolstered our collaboration with one another throughout the program.\n\n\n\nA picture of myself and many of the other students at Laguna Beach\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nOverall, ISI-BUDS was a fantastic program that further developed my technical skills while also introducing me to a community of like-minded statisticians that I hope to remain in contact with moving forward. Thank you to the directors of the program, the lecturers and mentors that taught many valuable lessons, and the other undergraduate students that made the experience unforgettable."
